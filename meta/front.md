## Description

|Attention! Standalone version sometimes may have an issue if you're using a controller and afk without alt-tabbing out of the game. If you experience this issue, alt-tab before going AFK.|

An application, Dalamud and ACT plugin for preventing being auto-kicked from FFXIV due to inactivity.

**Please use responsibly, this is meant to be used for gatherers or if you are waiting for raid/pf/event, not to just afk**

## Dalamud plugin
Recommended if you are using FFXIV Quick Launcher. Using AntiAfkKick as Dalamud plugin provides advantages of automatically launching together with game and automatic updates. ACT plugin and standalone version must be updated manually if ever needed.

Add my custom repo URL: 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightmareXIV/MyDalamudPlugins/main/pluginmaster.json` 

then install plugin from plugins list.

## ACT plugin
Download it here: https://github.com/NightmareXIV/AntiAfkKick/releases

Then copy it to any convenient folder. Open up ACT, go to "Plugins" tab, then to "Plugin Listing", then click "Browse" button and select DLL file you have just downloaded, and finally click "Add/Enable plugin". Upon doing so ACT may ask you to unblock file. In this case press "Yes".


## Standalone version
Just download it and run it. No configuration needed. To exit, access program's tray icon.
