# Description

|Attention! Standalone version sometimes may have an issue if you're using a controller and afk without alt-tabbing out of the game. If you experience this issue, alt-tab before going AFK.|

An application, Dalamud and ACT plugin for preventing being auto-kicked from FFXIV due to inactivity.

**Please use responsibly, this is meant to be used for gatherers or if you are waiting for raid/pf/event, not to just afk**

## Dalamud plugin
Recommended if you are using FFXIV Quick Launcher. Using AntiAfkKick as Dalamud plugin provides advantages of automatically launching together with game and automatic updates. ACT plugin and standalone version must be updated manually if ever needed.

Add my custom repo URL: 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightmareXIV/MyDalamudPlugins/main/pluginmaster.json` 

then install plugin from plugins list.

Detailed instruction available here: https://github.com/NightmareXIV/MyDalamudPlugins

## ACT plugin
Download it here: https://github.com/NightmareXIV/AntiAfkKick/releases

Then copy it to any convenient folder. Open up ACT, go to "Plugins" tab, then to "Plugin Listing", then click "Browse" button and select DLL file you have just downloaded, and finally click "Add/Enable plugin". Upon doing so ACT may ask you to unblock file. In this case press "Yes".


## Standalone version
Just download it and run it. No configuration needed. To exit, access program's tray icon.

## This plugin is feature complete
This means that everything that was planned for this plugin is implemented and there are no plans to add any more functions. The plugin is still being maintained and updated and bugs are being fixed, but no new feature requests are accepted. New features can still be implemented either via direct commission request or through patron votes.
